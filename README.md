## Description
rs_manager is a tool built to manage a botnet without using a database or any persistent data. In time clients will be able to reconnect automatically upon server restart (for now it freezes).

rs_manager uses core features but can handle modules. Those cannot be installed via update on the client for now. You can add your custom modules quite easily by adding the corresponding methods and messages to your custom server and client.
